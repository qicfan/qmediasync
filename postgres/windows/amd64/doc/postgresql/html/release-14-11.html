   This release contains a variety of fixes from 14.10.
   For information about new features in major release 14, see
   <a class="xref" href="release-14.html" title="E.13. Release 14">Section E.13</a>.

    A dump/restore is not required for those running 14.X.
   </p><p>
    However, one bug was fixed that could have resulted in corruption of
    GIN indexes during concurrent updates.  If you suspect such
    corruption, reindex affected indexes after installing this update.
   </p><p>
    Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 14.10,
    see <a class="xref" href="release-14-10.html" title="E.3. Release 14.10">Section E.3</a>.

      Tighten security restrictions within <code class="command">REFRESH MATERIALIZED
      VIEW CONCURRENTLY</code> (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>
      One step of a concurrent refresh command was run under weak security
      restrictions.  If a materialized view's owner could persuade a
      superuser or other high-privileged user to perform a concurrent
      refresh on that view, the view's owner could control code executed
      with the privileges of the user running <code class="command">REFRESH</code>.
      Fix things so that all user-determined code is run as the view's
      owner, as expected.

      The only known exploit for this error does not work
      in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 16.0 and later, so it may
      be that v16 is not vulnerable in practice.
     </p><p>

      Gallegos for reporting this problem.

      This fixes incorrect results when a subquery is underneath an outer

      outside the outer join's scope.  The output column might not appear
      as NULL when it should do so due to the action of the outer join.

      Prevent access to a no-longer-pinned buffer in <code class="literal">BEFORE ROW
      UPDATE</code> triggers (Alexander Lakhin, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      If the tuple being updated had just been updated and moved to
      another page by another session, there was a narrow window where
      we would attempt to fetch data from the new tuple version without
      any pin on its buffer.  In principle this could result in garbage
      data appearing in non-updated columns of the proposed new tuple.
      The odds of problems in practice seem rather low, however.

     </p><p>
      These places could fail to detect insertion of a volatile function
      default-argument expression, or decide that a polymorphic function
      is volatile although it is actually immutable on the datatype of

     </p><p>
      We expand any out-of-line fields in a catalog tuple before inserting
      it into the catalog caches.  That involves database access which
      might cause invalidation of catalog cache entries — but the
      new entry isn't in the cache yet, so we would miss noticing that it
      should get invalidated.  The result is a race condition in which an
      already-stale cache entry could get made, and then persist
      indefinitely.  This would lead to hard-to-predict misbehavior.
      Fix by rechecking the tuple's visibility after detoasting.

      A no-op <code class="command">ALTER LARGE OBJECT OWNER</code> command (that

      Prevent standby servers from incorrectly processing dead index
      tuples during subtransactions (Fei Changhong)
     </p><p>
      The <code class="structfield">startedInRecovery</code> flag was not
      correctly set for a subtransaction.  This affects only processing of
      dead index tuples.  It could allow a query in a subtransaction to
      ignore index entries that it should return (if they are already dead
      on the primary server, but not dead to the standby transaction), or
      to prematurely mark index entries as dead that are not yet dead on
      the primary.  It is not clear that the latter case has any serious
      consequences, but it's not the intended behavior.

      Fix deadlock between a logical replication apply worker, its
      tablesync worker, and a session process trying to alter the
      subscription (Shlok Kyal)
     </p><p>
      One edge of the deadlock loop did not involve a lock wait, so the
      deadlock went undetected and would persist until manual
      intervention.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Prevent examining system catalogs with the wrong snapshot during
      logical decoding (Fei Changhong)
     </p><p>
      If decoding begins partway through a transaction that modifies
      system catalogs, the decoder may not recognize that, causing it to
      fail to treat that transaction as in-progress for catalog lookups.
      This fix deals with the case that a top-level transaction is already
      marked as containing catalog changes, but its subtransaction(s) are
      not.

      Return the correct status code when a new client disconnects without
      responding to the server's password challenge (Liu Lang, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      In some cases we'd treat this as a loggable error, which was not the
      intention and tends to create log spam, since common clients
      like <span class="application">psql</span> frequently do this.  It may
      also confuse extensions that

      Use the BIO <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">app_data</span>”</span> field for our private storage,

      The pipeline state could get out of sync if an error is returned

      Previously, commands would be included in the dump to set these
