    A dump/restore is not required for those running 14.X.
   </p><p>
    However, note that installations using physical replication should
    update standby servers before the primary server, as explained in
    the third changelog entry below.
   </p><p>
    Also, several bugs have been found that may have resulted in corrupted
    indexes, as explained in the next several changelog entries.  If any
    of those cases apply to you, it's recommended to reindex
    possibly-affected indexes after updating.

      Make the server reject extraneous data after an SSL or GSS
      encryption handshake (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      A man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data into the TCP
      connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start of a
      supposedly encryption-protected database session.
      This could be abused to send faked SQL commands to the server,
      although that would only work if the server did not demand any
      authentication data.  (However, a server relying on SSL certificate
      authentication might well not do so.)

      A man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data into the TCP
      connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start of a
      supposedly encryption-protected database session.
      This could probably be abused to inject faked responses to the
      client's first few queries, although other details of libpq's
      behavior make that harder than it sounds.  A different line of
      attack is to exfiltrate the client's password, or other sensitive
      data that might be sent early in the session.  That has been shown
      to be possible with a server vulnerable to CVE-2021-23214.

      Fix physical replication for cases where the primary crashes
      after shipping a WAL segment that ends with a partial WAL record
      (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>
      If the primary did not survive long enough to finish writing the
      rest of the incomplete WAL record, then the previous crash-recovery
      logic had it back up and overwrite WAL starting from the beginning
      of the incomplete WAL record.  This is problematic since standby
      servers may already have copies of that WAL segment.  They will then
      see an inconsistent next segment, and will not be able to recover
      without manual intervention.  To fix, do not back up over a WAL
      segment boundary when restarting after a crash.  Instead write a new
      type of WAL record at the start of the next WAL segment, informing
      readers that the incomplete WAL record will never be finished and
      must be disregarded.
     </p><p>
      When applying this update, it's best to update standby servers
      before the primary, so that they will be ready to handle this new
      WAL record type if the primary happens to crash.

      Ensure that parallel <code class="command">VACUUM</code> doesn't miss any
      indexes (Peter Geoghegan, Masahiko Sawada)
     </p><p>
      A parallel <code class="command">VACUUM</code> would fail to process indexes
      that are below the <code class="varname">min_parallel_index_scan_size</code>
      cutoff, if the table also has at least two indexes that are above
      that size.  This could result in those indexes becoming corrupt,
      since they'd still contain references to any heap entries removed by
      the <code class="command">VACUUM</code>; subsequent queries using such indexes
      would be likely to return rows they shouldn't.
      This problem does not affect autovacuum, since it doesn't use
      parallel vacuuming.  However, it is advisable to reindex any
      manually-vacuumed tables that have the right mix of index sizes.

      Fix <code class="command">CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code> to wait for
      the latest prepared transactions (Andrey Borodin)
     </p><p>
      Rows inserted by just-prepared transactions might be omitted from
      the new index, causing queries relying on the index to miss such
      rows.  The previous fix for this type of problem failed to account
      for <code class="command">PREPARE TRANSACTION</code> commands that were still
      in progress when <code class="command">CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code>
      checked for them.  As before, in installations that have enabled
      prepared transactions (<code class="varname">max_prepared_transactions</code>
      &gt; 0), it's recommended to reindex any concurrently-built indexes
      in case this problem occurred when they were built.

     </p><p>
      While it's apparently rare in the field, this case could potentially
      affect any index built or reindexed with
      the <code class="literal">CONCURRENTLY</code> option.  It is recommended to
      reindex any such indexes to make sure they are correct.

      Fix incorrect creation of shared dependencies when cloning a
      database that contains non-builtin objects (Aleksander Alekseev)
     </p><p>
      The effects of this error are probably limited in practice.  In
      principle, it could allow a role to be dropped while it still owns
      objects; but most installations would never want to drop a role
      that had been used for objects they'd added
      to <code class="literal">template1</code>.

      Ensure that the relation cache is invalidated for a table being
      attached to or detached from a partitioned table (Amit Langote,
      Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>
      This oversight could allow misbehavior of subsequent inserts/updates
      addressed directly to the partition, but only in currently-existing
      sessions.

      Fix corruption of parse tree while creating a range type (Alex

     </p><p>
      <code class="command">CREATE TYPE</code> incorrectly freed an element of the
      parse tree, which could cause problems for a later event trigger, or
      if the <code class="command">CREATE TYPE</code> command was stored in the plan
      cache and used again later.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix updates of element fields in arrays of domain over composite
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      A command such as <code class="literal">UPDATE tab SET fld[1].subfld =
      val</code> failed if the array's elements were domains rather
      than plain composites.

      Disallow the combination of <code class="literal">FETCH FIRST WITH TIES</code>
      and <code class="literal">FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code> (David Christensen)
     </p><p>
      <code class="literal">FETCH FIRST WITH TIES</code> necessarily fetches one
      more row than requested, since it cannot stop until it finds a row
      that is not a tie.  In our current implementation,
      if <code class="literal">FOR UPDATE</code> is used then that row will also get
      locked even though it is not returned.  That results in undesirable
      behavior if the <code class="literal">SKIP LOCKED</code> option is specified.
      It's difficult to change this without introducing a different set of
      undesirable behaviors, so for now, forbid the combination.

      Disallow <code class="literal">ALTER INDEX index ALTER COLUMN col SET

      Fix planner error with pulling up subquery expressions into function
      rangetable entries (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      If a function in <code class="literal">FROM</code> laterally references the
      output of some sub-<code class="literal">SELECT</code> earlier in
      the <code class="literal">FROM</code> clause, and we are able to flatten that
      sub-<code class="literal">SELECT</code> into the outer query, the
      expression(s) copied into the function expression were not fully
      processed.  This could lead to crashes at execution.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Avoid using MCV-only statistics to estimate the range of a column
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      There are corner cases in which <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> will
      build a most-common-values (MCV) list but not a histogram, even
      though the MCV list does not account for all the observed values.
      In such cases, keep the planner from using the MCV list alone to
      estimate the range of column values.

      Fix restoration of a Portal's snapshot inside a subtransaction
      (Bertrand Drouvot)
     </p><p>
      If a procedure commits or rolls back a transaction, and then its
      next significant action is inside a new subtransaction, snapshot
      management went wrong, leading to a dangling pointer and probable
      crash.  A typical example in PL/pgSQL is a <code class="literal">COMMIT</code>
      immediately followed by a <code class="literal">BEGIN ... EXCEPTION</code>
      block that performs a query.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Clean up correctly if a transaction fails after exporting its
      snapshot (Dilip Kumar)
     </p><p>
      This oversight would only cause a problem if the same session
      attempted to export a snapshot again.  The most likely scenario for
      that is creation of a replication slot (followed by rollback)
      and then creation of another replication slot.

      Prevent wraparound of overflowed-subtransaction tracking on standby

      This oversight could cause significant performance degradation
      (manifesting as excessive SubtransSLRU traffic) on standby servers.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Ensure that prepared transactions are properly accounted for during
      promotion of a standby server (Michael Paquier, Andres Freund)
     </p><p>
      There was a narrow window where a prepared transaction could be
      omitted from a snapshot taken by a concurrently-running session.
      If that session then used the snapshot to perform data updates,
      erroneous results or data corruption could occur.

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Ensure that the correct lock level is used when renaming a table
      (Nathan Bossart, Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>
      For historical reasons, <code class="command">ALTER INDEX ... RENAME</code>
      can be applied to any sort of relation.  The lock level required to
      rename an index is lower than that required to rename a table or
      other kind of relation, but the code got this wrong and would use
      the weaker lock level whenever the command is spelled <code class="command">ALTER
      INDEX</code>.

      Avoid O(N^2) behavior in some list-manipulation operations
      (Nathan Bossart, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      These changes fix slow processing in several scenarios, including:
      when a standby replays a transaction that held many exclusive locks
      on the primary; when many files are due to be unlinked after a
      checkpoint; when hash aggregation involves many batches; and when
      <code class="filename">pg_trgm</code> extracts indexable conditions from a
      complex regular expression.  Only the first of these scenarios has
      actually been reported from the field, but they all seem like
      plausible consequences of inefficient list deletions.

     </p><p>
      This oversight was usually pretty harmless, since
      once <span class="application">pg_dump</span> has locked any of the leaf
      partitions, that would suffice to prevent significant DDL on the
      partitioned table itself.  However problems could ensue when dumping
