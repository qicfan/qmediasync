      Avoid rare PANIC during updates occurring concurrently
      with <code class="command">VACUUM</code> (Tom Lane, Jeff Davis)
     </p><p>
      If a concurrent <code class="command">VACUUM</code> sets the all-visible flag
      bit in a page that <code class="command">UPDATE</code>
      or <code class="command">DELETE</code> is in process of modifying, the
      updating command needs to clear that bit again; but some code paths
      failed to do so, ending in a PANIC exit and database restart.
     </p><p>
      This is known to be possible in versions 14 and 15.  It may be only
      latent in previous branches.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix handling of <code class="literal">DEFAULT</code> tokens that appear
      in a multi-row <code class="literal">VALUES</code> clause of an
      <code class="command">INSERT</code> on an updatable view (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      This oversight could lead to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cache lookup failed for
      type</span>”</span> errors, or in older branches even to crashes.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Disallow rules named <code class="literal">_RETURN</code> that are
      not <code class="literal">ON SELECT</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      This avoids confusion between a view's <code class="literal">ON SELECT</code>
      rule and any other rules it may have.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix resource management bug in saving tuples
      for <code class="literal">AFTER</code> triggers (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Given the right circumstances, this manifested as a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">tupdesc
      reference <em class="replaceable"><code>NNNN</code></em> is not owned by resource
      owner</span>”</span> error followed by a PANIC exit.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Avoid failure in <code class="command">EXPLAIN VERBOSE</code> for a query
      using <code class="literal">SEARCH BREADTH FIRST</code> with constant
      initial values (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix construction of per-partition foreign key constraints while
      doing <code class="command">ALTER TABLE ATTACH PARTITION</code>
      (Jehan-Guillaume de Rorthais, Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>
      Previously, incorrect or duplicate constraints could be constructed
      for the newly-added partition.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix generation of constraint names for per-partition foreign key
      constraints (Jehan-Guillaume de Rorthais)
     </p><p>
      If the initially-given name is already in use for some constraint of
      the partition, a new one is selected; but it wasn't being spelled as
      intended.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix incorrect matching of index expressions and predicates when
      creating a partitioned index (Richard Guo, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      While creating a partitioned index, we try to identify any existing
      indexes on the partitions that match the partitioned index, so that
      we can absorb those as child indexes instead of building new ones.
      Matching of expressions was not done right, so that a usable child
      index might be ignored, leading to creation of a duplicative index.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Prevent WAL corruption after a standby promotion (Dilip Kumar,
      Robert Haas)
     </p><p>
      When a <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> instance performing
      archive recovery (but not using standby mode) is promoted, and the
      last WAL segment that it attempted to read ended in a partial
      record, the instance would write an invalid WAL segment on the new
      timeline.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix mis-ordering of WAL operations in fast insert path for GIN
      indexes (Matthias van de Meent, Zhang Mingli)
     </p><p>
      This mistake is not known to have any negative consequences within
      core <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, but it did cause issues
      for some extensions.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix bugs in logical decoding when replay starts from a point
      between the beginning of a transaction and the beginning of its
      subtransaction (Masahiko Sawada, Kuroda Hayato)
     </p><p>
      These errors could lead to assertion failures in debug builds, and
      otherwise to memory leaks.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Prevent examining system catalogs with the wrong snapshot during
      logical decoding (Masahiko Sawada)
     </p><p>
      If decoding begins partway through a transaction that modifies
      system catalogs, the decoder may not recognize that, causing it to
      fail to treat that transaction as in-progress for catalog lookups.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Accept interrupts in more places during logical decoding (Amit
      Kapila, Masahiko Sawada)
     </p><p>
      This ameliorates problems with slow shutdown of replication workers.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Prevent attempts to replicate into a foreign-table partition in
      replication workers (Shi Yu, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Although partitioned tables can have foreign tables as partitions,
      replicating into such a partition isn't currently supported.
      The logical replication worker process would crash if it was
      attempted.  Now, an error is thrown.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Remove pointless check on replica identity setting of partitioned
      tables (Hou Zhijie)
     </p><p>
      What matters is the replica identity setting of the leaf partitions,
      so there's no need to throw error if it's not set on the parent.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Avoid crash after function syntax error in replication workers
      (Maxim Orlov, Anton Melnikov, Masahiko Sawada, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      If a syntax error occurred in a SQL-language or PL/pgSQL-language
      <code class="command">CREATE FUNCTION</code> or <code class="command">DO</code> command
      executed in a logical replication worker, the worker process would
      crash with a null pointer dereference or assertion failure.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix handling of read-write expanded datums that are passed to SQL
      functions (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      If a non-inlined SQL function uses a parameter in more than one
      place, and one of those functions expects to be able to modify
      read-write datums in place, then later uses of the parameter would
      observe the wrong value.  (Within
      core <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, the expanded-datum
      mechanism is only used for array and composite-type values; but
      extensions might use it for other structured types.)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix type <code class="type">circle</code>'s equality comparator to handle NaNs
      properly (Ranier Vilela)
     </p><p>
      If the left-hand circle had a floating-point NaN for its radius,
      it would be considered equal to a circle with the same center and
      any radius.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      In Snowball dictionaries, don't try to stem excessively-long words
      (Olly Betts, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      If the input word exceeds 1000 bytes, return it as-is after case
      folding, rather than trying to run it through the Snowball code.
      This restriction protects against a known
      recursion-to-stack-overflow problem in the Turkish stemmer, and it
      seems like good insurance against any other safety or performance
      issues that may exist in the Snowball stemmers.  Such a long string
      is surely not a word in any human language, so it's doubtful that
      the stemmer would have done anything desirable with it anyway.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix use-after-free hazard in string comparisons (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Improper memory management in the string comparison functions
      could result in scribbling on no-longer-allocated buffers,
      potentially breaking things for whatever is using that memory
      now.  This would only happen with fairly long strings (more than
      1kB), and only if an ICU collation is in use.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Add plan-time check for attempted access to a table that has no
      table access method (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      This prevents a crash in some catalog-corruption scenarios, for
      example use of a view whose <code class="literal">ON SELECT</code> rule is
      missing.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Prevent postmaster crash when shared-memory state is corrupted
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      The postmaster process is supposed to survive and initiate a
      database restart if shared memory becomes corrupted, but one
      bit of code was being insufficiently cautious about that.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Add some more defenses against recursion till stack overrun
      (Richard Guo, Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Avoid misbehavior when choosing hash table size with very
      small <code class="varname">work_mem</code> and large tuples (Zhang Mingli)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Avoid long-term memory leakage in the autovacuum launcher process
      (Reid Thompson)
     </p><p>
      The lack of field reports suggests that this problem is only latent
      in pre-v15 branches; but it's not very clear why, so back-patch the
      fix anyway.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Improve <span class="application">PL/pgSQL</span>'s ability to handle
      parameters declared as <code class="type">RECORD</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Build a separate function cache entry for each concrete type passed
      to the <code class="type">RECORD</code> parameter during a session, much as we do
      for polymorphic parameters.  This allows some usages to work that
      previously failed with errors such as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">type of parameter does
      not match that when preparing the plan</span>”</span>.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      In <span class="application">libpq</span>, handle single-row mode
      correctly when pipelining (Denis Laxalde)
     </p><p>
      The single-row flag was not reset at the correct time if pipeline
      mode was also active.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Add missing guards for <code class="literal">NULL</code> connection pointer
      in <span class="application">libpq</span> (Daniele Varrazzo, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      There's a convention that <span class="application">libpq</span> functions
      should check for a NULL PGconn argument, and fail gracefully instead
      of crashing.  <code class="function">PQflush()</code>
      and <code class="function">PQisnonblocking()</code> didn't get that memo, so
      fix them.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      In <span class="application">ecpg</span>, fix omission of variable storage
      classes when multiple <code class="type">varchar</code> or <code class="type">bytea</code>
      variables are declared in the same declaration (Andrey Sokolov)
     </p><p>
      For example, <span class="application">ecpg</span>
      translated <code class="literal">static varchar str1[10], str2[20],
      str3[30];</code> in such a way that only <code class="varname">str1</code>
      was marked <code class="literal">static</code>.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Allow cross-platform tablespace relocation
      in <span class="application">pg_basebackup</span> (Robert Haas)
     </p><p>
      Allow the remote path in <code class="option">--tablespace-mapping</code> to be
      either a Unix-style or Windows-style absolute path, since the source
      server could be on a different OS than the local system.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      In <span class="application">pg_stat_statements</span>, fix access to
      already-freed memory (zhaoqigui)
     </p><p>
      This occurred if <span class="application">pg_stat_statements</span>
      tracked a <code class="command">ROLLBACK</code> command issued via extended
      query protocol.  In debug builds it consistently led to an assertion
      failure.  In production builds there would often be no visible ill
      effect; but if the freed memory had already been reused, the likely
      result would be to store garbage for the query string.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      In <span class="application">postgres_fdw</span>, ensure that target lists
      constructed for EvalPlanQual plans will have all required columns
      (Richard Guo, Etsuro Fujita)
     </p><p>
      This avoids <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">variable not found in subplan target list</span>”</span>
      errors in rare cases.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Reject unwanted output from the platform's
      <code class="function">uuid_create()</code> function (Nazir Bilal Yavuz)
     </p><p>
      The <span class="application">uuid-ossp</span> module expects
      libc's <code class="function">uuid_create()</code> to produce a version-1
      UUID, but recent NetBSD releases produce a version-4 (random) UUID
      instead.  Check for that, and complain if so.  Drop the
      documentation's claim that the NetBSD implementation is usable
      for <span class="application">uuid-ossp</span>.
      (If a version-4 UUID is okay for your purposes, you don't
      need <span class="application">uuid-ossp</span> at all; just
      use <code class="function">gen_random_uuid()</code>.)

      Include new Perl test modules in standard installations
      (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>
      Add <code class="filename">PostgreSQL/Test/Cluster.pm</code> and
      <code class="filename">PostgreSQL/Test/Utils.pm</code> to the standard
      installation file set in pre-version-15 branches.  This is for the
      benefit of extensions that want to use newly-written test code in
      older branches.

      On NetBSD, force dynamic symbol resolution at postmaster start
      (Andres Freund, Tom Lane)

      This avoids a risk of deadlock in the dynamic linker on NetBSD 10.

      Update time zone data files to <span class="application">tzdata</span>
      release 2022f for DST law changes in Chile, Fiji, Iran, Jordan,

     </p><p>
      Also, the Europe/Kiev zone has been renamed to Europe/Kyiv.
      Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby,
      more-populous zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970:
      Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Brunei,
      Asia/Kuala_Lumpur, Atlantic/Reykjavik, Europe/Amsterdam,
      Europe/Copenhagen, Europe/Luxembourg, Europe/Monaco, Europe/Oslo,
      Europe/Stockholm, Indian/Christmas, Indian/Cocos, Indian/Kerguelen,
      Indian/Mahe, Indian/Reunion, Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Funafuti,
      Pacific/Majuro, Pacific/Pohnpei, Pacific/Wake and Pacific/Wallis.
      (This indirectly affects zones that were already links to one of
      these: Arctic/Longyearbyen, Atlantic/Jan_Mayen, Iceland,
      Pacific/Ponape, Pacific/Truk, and Pacific/Yap.)  America/Nipigon,
      America/Rainy_River, America/Thunder_Bay, Europe/Uzhgorod, and
      Europe/Zaporozhye were also merged into nearby zones after
      discovering that their claimed post-1970 differences from those
      zones seem to have been errors.
      In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias;
      but the actual data is that of the zone that was merged into.
     </p><p>
      These zone mergers result in loss of pre-1970 timezone history for
      the merged zones, which may be troublesome for applications
      expecting consistency of <code class="type">timestamptz</code> display.  As an
      example, the stored value <code class="literal">1944-06-01 12:00 UTC</code>
      would previously display as <code class="literal">1944-06-01
      13:00:00+01</code> if the Europe/Stockholm zone is selected, but
      now it will read out as <code class="literal">1944-06-01 14:00:00+02</code>.
     </p><p>
      It is possible to build the time zone data files with options that
      will restore the older zone data, but that choice also inserts a lot
      of other old (and typically poorly-attested) zone data, resulting in
      more total changes from the previous release than accepting these
      upstream changes does.  <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> has
      chosen to ship the <span class="productname">tzdb</span> data
      as-recommended, and so far as we are aware most major operating
      system distributions are doing likewise.  However, if these changes
      cause significant problems for your application, a possible solution
      is to install a local build of the time zone data files using
      <span class="productname">tzdb</span>'s backwards-compatibility options
      (see their <code class="literal">PACKRATDATA</code>
      and <code class="literal">PACKRATLIST</code> options).
